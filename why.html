        "Did You Ever Notice..." is a website that tracks editing differences between the episodes of "Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee" as currently aired on Netflix, and the original versions as aired on Crackle and the eponymous website. All differences noted are entirely from memory as the first-run videos were removed after the Netflix acquisition.

         A comedian makes subtle but crucial choices when building an act. Living in NYC, I get to see some of the best as they select bits, move around content, and shape their act over the course of many months. As Seinfeld told Letterman, what's perhaps unique about "Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee" is that it's the first edited talk show. If we compare the similarities between constructing a set and constructing an episode, the performer can modify cadence, content placement, visuals, and so many other elements. If we analyze why these edits were made before the Netflix airing, does it express some new intention? Why did the artist believe those edits were necessary? Much of the additional content here adds historical context, and as we know, Seinfeld loves reminding an audience of things that were once commonplace which we no longer see. Do the new edits give us a glimpse into the creator's interests - or are the added lines are just added laughs? Whether or not one wants to accept alternate intentions is up to the individual observer.
